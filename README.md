Just a few helper scripts I like to keep around.

eindent: uses emacs to reindent files matching a glob. This loads your emacs config to apply your own indentation rules.
prepend: prepends a string to files
random: simple random int generator using awk
redirect: prints what url a given url redirects to (from a curl response)
rmds: removes .DS_STORE recursively from ./*
statuscode: prints the http status code of a curl response
